I find PowerBI pretty cool. Here a few examples of visualizations built with PowerBi

## **Dashboard 1: Premier League Summary**
My mother was an avid football fan. I'm not much of a football fan, myself unfortunately.
Saturday afternoons at our house were match days. I've got pleasant memories of a noisy living room full of guests, huddled around her little coloured tv, snacks and drinks in abundance, and lots of banter and half baked commentary. Her favourite team was Arsenal, in the Premier League and I remember, in the glory days of Aresene Wenger, and great players like Thierry Henry, Patrick Vierra, Faregas and Pires.

The 2022/23 Premier League was the 31st season of the English Premier League.
This visualization is a summary of the Premier League 2022/23 season. Mum would be pleased to see her team end the season so close the top. The Premier League website has a table that shows all the teams and their current rankings. I linked this table to my Power Bi dashboard and used visualizations to pull out interesting stats from the season!

### Insights
- Manchester City topped the league with the most wins and highest points. No suprise there, as they were in top form all season. I'm sure City fans are super proud of the Title, their ninth English title overall. 
- with 25 losses, Southampton had the worst performance of the season and got relegated. They'll be playing second tier this 2023/24 season. There'll definitely be some soul searching and in-house organization, if they're serious about winning promotion back.
- Leicester with the second highest number of losses (22) were also relegated. 
- Brentford & Newcastle United tied for the most draws
- With 1,084 goals, the 2022-23 season was the highest scoring 38-game season in Premier League history.
